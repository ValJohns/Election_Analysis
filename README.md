# üó≥Ô∏è Election Audit üó≥Ô∏è
## Overview: 
*The board of Election has requested a breakdown of the election that just concluded. The initial request that was presented to me was to provided a candidate breakdown. The candidate breakdown included that following analysis: Voter allocation per candidate which was showcased the raw number of votes and also the percentage conversion and highlight the proposed winner of the election and the voter information related to that candidate. The election commission also handed me the task to dive deep into the voter turnout based on county. I took the analysis a step further by breaking down the total votes by the amount of counties that appeared in the dataset (percentage included) and I showcased the county with the largest turnout.*

- This congressional election had **369,711** votes casted.

## **Election Audit Summary:**
I beleive this script has the flexibilty to be used in various campaigns on all levels. Depending on the level of elections local, state , federal or proposals on the ballot we can make the proper modifications for it to be used. For local elections, we could possibly produced a breakdown by polling location in the respective city. Another modification can be regarding proposals on the ballot , we can disover the amounts of "Yes" or "No" votes also.
